# SecMED
  An application that allow the doctor to manage the patient information safely, able to access from anywhere using the registered IP address
  - Features
    - Use of Advanced Encryption System (AES) to encrypt & decrypt the data.
    - Use of Ciphertext-policy attribute-based encryption (CP-ABE) to encrypt the symmetric key.
    - Use of Rivest-Shamir-Adleman encryption (RSA) to transform the ciphertext to digital signature.
    - Use of Homomorphic encryption to create an additional key which is used to enchance the confidentiality of digital signature.
    - Use of SHA-256 Hashing Algorithm to create an index of ciphertext.

      - MD_id  : a hash value of patient id which is used as an index for retrieving the document for the medicat treatment record of the patient.
      - CT     : an encrypted form of MTR of the patient.
      - enc_SK : an encrypted form of the secret key SK which is encrypted by a CP-ABE method.
      - DS*R   : a digital signature of the latest updater shuffled with the random value (R). 
      - R1     : a new random value of the original R. It is generated by applying shuffling between R and another random value (R’).
